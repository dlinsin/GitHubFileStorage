GitHubFileStorage
=================

A Mac OSX service using the wiki of a GitHub project as a replacement for the GitHub Download Area. 
It creates a link which can be pasted from your Clipboard.

##  Requirements

You need CLI Push&Pull access without a password prompt to the wiki of the GitHub project you want to upload the files to. 
In case you don't know how to set it up, check out https://help.github.com/articles/ssh-key-setup.

The repository you want to store files in needs a wiki setup. Just click the wiki link of your 
repository once.

The service needs [Growl](http://growl.info/) to be installed in order to deliver some progress information.

Your user's Downloads folder is used as a temporary storage, so the service needs read/write access to it.

## Installation

Double-click `GitHubFileStorage.workflow` and select installation as a service when Automator prompts you.

## How to upload files

Select on or multiple files and right-click to bring up the context menu. Select GitHubFileStorage

The service will prompt you for the name of the repository, including the organization or username. 
For this repository it would be _dlinsin/GitHubFileStorage_:

Once the upload was successful, the URLs will be copied to the clipboard and can be pasted anywhere.

Each step is confirmed by a Growl notification, the final notification is posted multiple times in 
case you uploaded multiple files:
